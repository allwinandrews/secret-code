# secret-code
This project retrieves character data with `x` and `y` coordinates from a Google Doc URL, parses it using Cheerio, and displays it as a visual grid. The code creates a 2D grid filled with spaces, places each character at its specified coordinates, and prints the grid to form a graphic representation based on the input data.
